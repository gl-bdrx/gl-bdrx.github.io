I was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, where you can get the best barbeque you've ever had [in a gas station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe%27s_Kansas_City_Bar-B-Que#/media/File:Joe's_Kansas_City_Barbeque.jpg). 

The upper Midwest and Great Lakes region is my adopted home. Prior to graduate school, I worked as an economist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Chicago, which was a master class in both infrastructure policy and political economy.

In my free time I enjoy being as close to water as possible, reading [science fiction](https://www.jeffvandermeer.com/), and listening to music- mostly [hardcore punk](https://dischord.com/band/fugazi) and [alternative country](https://jasonmolina.com/#home-section).
